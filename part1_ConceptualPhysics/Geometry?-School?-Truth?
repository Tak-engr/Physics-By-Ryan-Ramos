Physics has been a major interest of mine this year. After learning physics in college and doing self-research on certain subjects, I realized that physics is just one big mind game. 
  Once you figure it out, it changes your perspective of reality, especially when it comes to things that are taught to us in elementary, middle, and high school. I learned that what they teach is just a super simplified version of what it actually is, all just to avoid confusion so that the majority can agree on something. 
  However, what we all agree on that is “true” or a “fact” isn’t actually always “true” or a “fact.” That realization is what made me and others so addicted to learning conceptual physics.
Examples:
 Geometry: What we learned in school is called Euclidean geometry, which is based on axioms (assumptions that are just taken to be self-evidently true).  What I’ve been learning from Einstein’s book, Relativity: The Special and the General Theory, is that pure geometry isn’t just about lines and points, and that the idea of "one straight line going through two points" isn’t some absolute truth, it’s just an assumption we all agree on for simplicity.
  Einstein basically says geometry is about what works in a given situation, not some fixed universal truth.  That’s why the geometry we learned in school doesn’t apply when it comes to things like space-time and the speed of light. 
  So instead of thinking of geometry as just “math about shapes and angles,” we should actually treat it as a part of physics.  Even at UCF, Physics 1 and 2 are taught with calculus and analytic geometry, which shows that geometry plays a real role in describing how the universe works. What we learned in school is just a simplified version, not the whole story of what geometry really is.
